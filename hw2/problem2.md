#### Question 2

##### 1. 

There are $m*n-k$ tiles

##### 2.

We need to place $m*n - k$ tiles in $m*n$ squares

so there are $(m*n)!/((m*n) - (m*n - k))!$ possible states

##### 3.

A, B, C represents the names of the nodes, and according to 2., we should have 24 possible states.

The pic shows the states generated by move one node clockwise.
