The Artificial Intelligence has already dramatically changed our life. Famous examples are Machine Learning, Robot, Internet of Things (IoT), etc. One specific usage of AI that is known by public is in transportation. There are many companies invented, or are inventing cars with AI that can help drive the cars. According to Stone at al (2016), the researchers claim that in 2030 the AI could be used on not only personal cars and trunks, but also the flying vehicles and other daily transportations. However, I donâ€™t believe the AI could be used such widely at that time due to the problem of accidents resolving and employments. 

First of all, the AIs cannot cover all aspects of solving an accident in traffic. There are several car crash example now, which are made by auto drive AIs. If, in the future, all cars are driven by AIs themselves, and passengers are not able to drive the cars, it would be a disaster for the traffic if there is an accident. The cars cannot be moved, so it will block the traffic and the whole system will go down. 

Second, driving cars and trucks are very important for employment. Millions of people are employed as drivers. If all cars will be driven by AIs, there would be millions of people who cannot, or hard to get jobs. That would be a serious problem for the government to solve.  Meantime, the loss of employment cannot be covered by the employment opportunities brought by the development of AI, because those jobs requires professional knowledge pretty much. 

So in this case, I would rather to claim that the AIs, in the future, would be more likely to be used as an auxiliary ways to drive a car or truck. It would be better to use to reduce the fatigue of drivers when driving a long haul.
